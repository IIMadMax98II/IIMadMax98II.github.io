                        Storm Sailors is my first project during my time in the BTS. For the first time ever, we joined forces with the
                        art class (us being the programmers/designers). The game is a single-player side-scroller arcade shooter. It takes
                        you aboard the Tempesta, which can shoot cannon balls as far as the eye can see, and it is loaded with an ultimate
                        attack that will devastate everyone in your path. It offers the player a broad selection of Power-Ups to destroy
                        your enemies.
                        <br><br>
                        You will be facing many challenges in these skies. There will be pirates who will attack you from different directions.
                        These can range from Bombers that will try to take you down with them to the Cruiser, who will be flying around and
                        shooting you... but wait, let's not forget the Cruiser's bigger and meaner brother, the Heavy Cruiser. This bad boy
                        will bring a nice challenge to the player since it's equipped with extra shielding that will make it harder to be
                        taken down.
                        <br><br>
                        But we are not done yet; There will be distinct bosses waiting to take their turn to take you down. 
                        This game aims to make it both challenging and fun for the player.

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        During this project, my main focus was on design and audio. I made three tracks for the game; one of them can be 
                        heard on the trailer. I spent most of my time during this project testing the game and documenting all my ideas in 
                        the GDD, as well as coordinating with the lead programmer and the artist to make sure we were meeting schedule. I 
                        even got to do some visual effects to add up a lighting effect for the ultimate attack, as well as other effects 
                        included on the trailer.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My main challenge during this project was my programming experience and that it was my first time using blueprints. 
                        I was not very confident with Unreal's Blueprint System which led me to spend a lot of hours reading documentation 
                        and researching online.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Although I did not participate in the main scripting of the game, I took the lead on fixing bugs and testing the game. 
                        Which helps me a lot to understand Unreal's Blueprint System. It also reinforced my confidence when working with someone 
                        else's code.
