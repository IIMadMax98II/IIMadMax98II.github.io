										<p> Storm Sailors is my first project during my time of the BTS. For the first time ever, we joined forces with the art class (us being the programmers/designers). 
											The game is a single player side-scroller arcade shooter. It takes you aboard the Tempesta, which can shoot cannon balls as far as the eye can see and it is loaded with a ultimate attack which will devastate everyone in your path. 
											It offers the player a broad selection of power ups to destroy your enemies. 
											<br><br>
											You will be facing many challenges in these skies; There will be pirates who will attack you from different directions. 
											These can range from Bombers that will try to take you down with them, to the Cruiser, who will be flying around and shoot you... but wait, lets not forget the Cruiser's bigger and meaner brother, the Heavy Cruiser. 
											This bad boy will bring a nice challenge to the player, since its equiped with extra shielding that will make it harder to be taken down.
											<br><br>
											But we are not done yet, there will be distinct bosses waiting to take their turn to take you down.
											This game aims to make it both challenging and fun for the player.

										<img class="image right" style="margin:0" src="images/tempesta.png" alt="Ship" />
										<p style="vertical-align: middle;"> During this project my main focus was towards design and audio. I made 3 tracks for the game, one of the can be heard on the trailer while the other two where lost when resetting my pc. 
										I spent most of my time during this project testing the game and documenting all my ideas in the GDD, as well as coordinating with the lead programmer and the artist to make sure we where meeting schedule. 
										I even got to do some after effects to add up a lighting effect for the ultimate attack.

										<p> 
											My main challenge during this project was my programming experience and that it was my first time using blueprints. 
											I was not very confident with Unreal's Blueprint System which led me to spend a lot of ours reading documentation and researching online.

										<p style="vertical-align: middle;">
											Although i did not participated on the main scripting of the game, i took mayor part on fixing bugs and testing the game. Which help me a lot to understand Unreal's Blueprint System. 
											It also reinforced my confidence when working with someone elses code.
