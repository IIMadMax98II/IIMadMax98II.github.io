										<p> After an unsuccessful launch, the SS-H2 (Surveillance Spacecraft Hound 2) is stranded on space. Waiting for rescue, the player is set on the feet of Arnold Strider, the only crew member in the space craft. After 1 month of total isolation, Strider has suffered severe damage to his mental health. Things do not end up there, power has shot down in certain areas, including the life support system and it is on Strider’s best interest to get into the reactor room and reset the power before is too late.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Designer Goals</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Iso01.png" alt="" /></span>I aim to make the objective of the game as simple as possible but still enjoyable. The reason behind this is that I will be focusing more on how the game feels rather that the chore mechanics. The best thing about horror games, especially the psychological genre, is that it leaves a lot to the player’s imagination and constantly plays with their expectations. The objective of the game is to gather 4 fuses to power up the reactor door and reset the electricity while they are being haunted by an unknown entity. </p>
									<h6>Core Goal</h6>
									<p>My main goal is to create a memorable horror experience. I aim to put the player in the character’s shoes and make the Strider’s struggles, their struggles.</p>
									<h6>Tone and Mood</h6>
									<p>The game main objective is to create a gloom and claustrophobic atmosphere, it will be achieved using poor lighting and close spaces. Background sound will also help, as well as using fog to set up a cold atmosphere.</p>
									<h6>Genre</h6>
									<p>The game will be utilizing psychological horror theme to tell the story of a stranded man on the vast emptiness of space.Throughtout the game the player will experience visions and other sort of torments that arise as they try to complete the prime objective.</p>
									<h6>Lighting</h6>
									<p>One important pillar for guiding the player and setting up interesting events. Some lights will be placed in specific parts of the ship to guide the player towards their objective. They will also flicker whenever the entity is nearby.</p>
									<h6>Sound</h6>
									<p>Sounds will be extremely important for this game. I will be used recorded audio logs for narrative storytelling, whispers (when player mental health is affected) and sound effects for material interactions.</p>

										<p> During this project i was introduced to a concept i never seen before; Logic Diagrams. The idea behind them is to write down all players interactions, leaving nothing for improvisation. After several attempts i manage to have a solid diagram mapping each and every posible outcome for the player. This diagram allowed me to focus on the most important facts, instead of loosing time trying to think how to implement an idea.

											If you are interested in seeing the diagram at its entirety, please make sure to download it here.

										<p style="vertical-align: middle;">
											 The major challenge during this project was keeping the FPS at a value of 72. Anything lower would cause the user to have motion sickness, and it being a game aimed to target user experience this was not posible. After teaching myself how occlusion works in Unity i was able to reduce the rendering demand, thus incrementing the frames. I also managed to selectively avoid collisions when there was no need to be any, allowing the engine to spend less time calculating unnecessary stuff.

											This project would not exist if it werent for the Virtual Rangers. Matthieu Bracchetti, taught me the importance of user first design. I learn a lot during this internship, most of the concepts learned i still use on current projects. I will be linking their website down below if you are interested in knowing more about the company.
