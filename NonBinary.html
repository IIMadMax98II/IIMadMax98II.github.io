					<p style="text-align:justify;">
					This project was a small assignment I had during my studies in Dundalk's Institute of Technology. The main task was to make
					a top-down URP project with some minimum requirements such as interactions, inventory system, dialogue, winning and 
					loosing conditions, as well as, use of pathfinding to generate a point and click movement. Despite it being a quite small 
					and simple project, i use most if not all the techniques learned today in my projects.

					<h2>Story & Design Goals</h2>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">
						The story is about a robot who suddenly gains consciousness after a collision with another robot, both realising that 
						they are stuck in a corporate world where each machine serves a purpose, those who don't stick to that purpose 
						get scrapped and converted into new units. 
						<br><br>
						With the sole purpose of finding freedom, both machines team up to find a way out of the facility. 
						Starting at the top level of the facility, player needs to keep heading down until reaching
						ground level and scape through one of the gates.
						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NonBinary/DialoguePopUps.png" alt="" /></a>
						For the design of the game, i tried to keep complexity to a minimum but with each task required for the assignment in 
						mind. Although i chosen to break immersion on the tutorial, for the purpose of quickly getting the player used to the
						controls and interactions with the world, the rest of  the interactions with the world or guides to the player will 
						be part of the world using dialogue, eye catching designs and use of tools such as light and sound to provide information.

						<h2>Enemy Pathfinding & Design</h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NonBinary/Enemy.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					 Utilizing Unity's Nav mesh, I was able to quickly program and test both player movement and enemy movement. However i didn't
					 want the enemies to immediately know and track down the player, instead I opted for giving it different states. 
					 <br><br>
					 One being standard patrol, through a predetermined path; Chase for when it sees the player and searching for when it looses sight. This
					 last state remains active for a few seconds as it leads the enemy towards the player last known location and then looks around 
					 that area before going back to patrolling, unless it finds the player which would prompt a new chase.
					 <br><br>
					 To accomodate to my design choices to provide player feedback that is compliant to the world, enemy's light (which represents vision cone)
					 changes color depending on their current state. It being red to signify a chase state and provide a sense of danger. 
					 <br><br>
					 In addition, there is a sound component attached to the enemy AI that makes the presence known as the music plays louder when closer to the player. If player
					 does not see the light, they can use their hearing to tell where enemies are before being detected or even seeing them.

						<h2>Lighting</h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NonBinary/InteractionPopUp.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						Probably the most challenging part of the project, as the light on editor never did look like the one on build or play time.
						Never truly found out whether it was a bug within the engine or if I was doing something wrong when making them. Unfortunately,
						I did not have much time to give it the proper attention as I was on a tight schedule.
						<br><br>
						I used different type of lights, since realtime lights are limited on URP and they take extra rendering power that will affect framerate.
						For things such as room lighting I kept realtime to add immersion, however for static objects that dont really need to cast shadows I used
						baked lights. 
						<br><br>
						It didn't take long for me to realise that having bake lights to items that may disappear, like the keycard, resulted in
						light effects on walls and floors with the light source no longer being there. This forced me to change my strategy and make baked lights
						out of the ones that do not disappear or change throughout the level. Loosing a bit of realism in exchange of better performance.
						<br><br>
						URP settings seemed to also conflict on how the lighting worked and affected the game, however my inexperience managing reuslted in it 
						lowered quality of the game's looks.

						<h2>Interactions</h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NonBinary/Interaction.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						For the interactions, i decided to play around with zooming into objects and being able to move them around. This mechanic is something
						I always been a fan of, utilized in games such as resident evil or escape simulator. I am always intrigued by the way thing are made, 
						thus I always make it an extra challenge to try to reproduce it.
						<br><br>
						The actual coding behind it is rather simple but it adds to the player's interaction with the world. Sometimes is hard to immerse yourself
						in a world that you can barely associate with, making you more of an observant than an important actor within the universe.

						<h2>Challenges</h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NonBinary/EndGame.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						Apart from the lighting challenges stated above, the URP engine seemed quite complex at first, however I have managed to
						get better results and be more confortable with on future projects such as "Pestis."
						<br><br>
						Camera movement, was a bit of a problem at first, given that some of the walls were rather thick and i needed to adjust
						its movement and zoom to allow the player to both see what they were doing and getting as much information as posible from
						their surroundings to then make decisions. Camera movement also needed to be smoothed to avoid creating nausea, 
						which took some iterations but was not a major issue.

					<h2>Learning Outcomes & Technical Playthrough</h2>

				<p style="text-align:justify;">
					I believe that one of the most valuable lessons I had during this project was the important of generating early builds to test
					discrepancies between editor and the final product; As well as some insight into possible issues and pre-planning regarding lighting
					and use of static objects.
					<br><br>
					Moreover, I gotten used to the player's input module provided by unity and its use of events to trigger certain methods without
					the need to run checks through the update. It is by the use of delegates that i now run important checks on my game without 
					polluting Update methods that runs every frame.
