                        During this project I worked as Lead Game Designer and Scrum Master.
                        I was responsible for the development of the Game Design Documentation, Flow Charts, organising Sprint Meetings and documenting the results.
                        I was also in charge of the communication between both programmers and artist, to ensure that both sectors well informed of each others progress.

                        The game orbits around player to player cooperation.
                        There are a 3 main classes on the game that will be given at random to force players to adapt and be able to play any of the classes.
                        However for private matches, players will be able to directly choose.
                        Each class grants the player a unique sets of abilities that will allow them to complete quests or work around obstacles.

                        Players are considered prey throughout the entirety of game; 
                        enforced throughout the experience by giving them abilities that do not empower them, 
                        while the displaying scenarios, atmosphere, tone/mood that oppress them.
                        <br><br>
                        Cameras that are close and personal. Surroundings that seem menacing and unforgiving, 
                        as well as having creatures that will be around hunting for you and cannot be killed or vanquished.
                        <br><br>
                        There will be a timer that will rush players to finish the game, the timer itself will work as the player’s health bar.
                        Once the timer reaches 0, that player will be stuck in this world forever.
                        Each player will have their own timer and there will be instances in which they can add time or loose it.
                        For example saving a lost soul (npc with sidequests that reward players) or giving away time to a player that lost their own.
                        <br><br>
                        You must get out before your time reaches 0 or you will loose the game.

                        The map will act as a giant clock, every certain amount of time a new area will be unlock, until the last one,
                        being a massive gate, that the players must have collected certain ammount of keys (obtained in other areas) to open it.
                        <br><br>
                        After reaching the gate, players will have to fight the Gate Keeper which will be a massive entity that will try to stop them.
                        The players wont be able to attack the creature directly but will be able to use their surroundings and abilities to defeat it.
